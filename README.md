# asciiheader README

asciiheader creates ASCII headers in your source code 

## About

I like to put headers into my CSS source so I can see more easily where I am in the minimap in VSCode. To do that, I've been using sites like http://www.network-science.de/ascii/ to convert text into headers. I got tired of this and decided to build an extension to do this. 

## Example



## Status

WIP. This extension works if you build it manually. I haven't finished testing it yet.
